# Introduction

This is an [Eimi Isami](https://www.youtube.com/@eimiisami) VR model that I made over the course of a year. It will work in some VR programs, though I have only tested it on a few (I mostly tested it on [Snek Studio](https://snekstudio.com/)). The model is _mostly_ textured; I used some shaders like the MToon shader to fill in the blanks. Also, the model is rigged; it has a skeletal structure, as well as blend shapes for facial animations. A user can probably do motion capture with the model, or pose it in various ways.

# Download

To download the model, look at the "Release" page. Since the file size for the model is quite large, I had to shrink it down via LZMA compression, i.e. a file with the "xz" extension. Most archive programs nowadays can open it up.

# FAQs

Q: Why did you make this model?
A: I wanted to learn how to make a 3D model and I also wanted to make a model for Eimi Isami.

Q: What software did you use to make the model?
A: Blender?

Q: How many triangles are in the model?
A: There are well over 100,000 triangles in the model.

Q: Can I use this model?
A: Yes. You can use it in VR programs, games, and videos. You may _not_, though, use it in any work that is violent/gory, pornographic, or political. Also, the 3D model must be distributed as-is; no editing of the model may be done. This decision may change in the future, though.

Q: Why did you only distribute it through GitHub?
A: Most VR model distribution platforms (like VRModels and Sketchfab) require an account to download the file. Others like Live3D don't support the license I want to use (that, and you have to set up other accounts just to list a model for free). I wanted to distribute this model in a way where the user only needs to click "download" and I can release the model under a license of my choice.
